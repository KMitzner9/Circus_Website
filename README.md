# Circus_Website
This is where I will host my files for my circus website. I created this website to learn more how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in concert to make a functional website from scratch. As I learn more, I will add additional functionality and complexity to the site. Below, I will list the skills learned in the process.

### Skills Learned
* Website Layout with HTML
* CSS Style Sheets
* Scrolling text over a stationary background image
* Modal Lightbox Photo Gallery
* Functional contact form

### Features to add
* Multiple pages
* Event Calender w/ Booking request functionality
* Media page
* Price sheet
